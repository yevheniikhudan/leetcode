# Algorithm Drawings & Visualizations

This folder contains visual representations, diagrams, and step-by-step drawings for LeetCode problems.

## Purpose

Use this folder to store:
- Algorithm flowcharts
- Data structure visualizations
- Step-by-step execution traces
- Problem-solving sketches
- Complexity analysis diagrams

## Recommended Tools

### Excalidraw (Hand-drawn style)
- Online: https://excalidraw.com
- VS Code Extension: `excalidraw-editor`
- File format: `.excalidraw` (JSON-based, can be version controlled)

### draw.io (Professional diagrams)
- Online: https://app.diagrams.net
- VS Code Extension: `hediet.vscode-drawio`
- File format: `.drawio` or `.drawio.svg`

## Naming Convention

Name your drawings to match the corresponding problem:

```
<problem_name>_<type>.<extension>

Examples:
- daily_temperatures_visualization.excalidraw
- car_fleet_flowchart.drawio
- sliding_window_maximum_trace.png
- valid_parentheses_stack.svg
```

## Organization

Feel free to create subdirectories by topic:
- `stack/` - Stack-related problems
- `sliding_window/` - Sliding window problems
- `two_pointers/` - Two pointer problems
- etc.

## Tips

1. **Export to PNG/SVG** for easy viewing without special tools
2. **Keep source files** (.excalidraw, .drawio) for editing later
3. **Add descriptions** in the drawing or in a companion markdown file
4. **Version control**: Both .excalidraw and .drawio files are text-based and git-friendly!
