**Difficulty:** Easy
**Topics:** Array
**Source:** [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-all-1s-are-at-least-length-k-places-away/)

## Problem Description

Given a binary array `nums` and an integer `k`, return `true` if all `1`'s are at least `k` places away from each other, otherwise return `false`.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1], k = 2
Output: true
Explanation: Each of the 1s are at least 2 places away from each other.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,0,0,1,0,1], k = 2
Output: false
Explanation: The second 1 and third 1 are only one apart from each other.
```

## Constraints
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= k <= nums.length`
- `nums[i]` is `0` or `1`.
