# Smallest Integer Divisible by K

**Difficulty**: Medium

## Problem Description

Given a positive integer `k`, you need to find the **length** of the smallest positive integer `n` such that `n` is divisible by `k`, and `n` only contains the digit `1`.

Return the length of `n`. If there is no such `n`, return `-1`.

**Note**: `n` may not fit in a 64-bit signed integer.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: k = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: The smallest answer is n = 1, which has length 1.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: k = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no such positive integer n divisible by 2.
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The smallest answer is n = 111, which has length 3.
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= k <= 10^5`

## Hints

1. `11111 = 1111 * 10 + 1`. We only need to store remainders modulo K.
2. If we never get a remainder of 0, why would that happen, and how would we know that?
