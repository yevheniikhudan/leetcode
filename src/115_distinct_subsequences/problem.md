# 115. Distinct Subsequences

## Difficulty: Hard

## Topics: String, Dynamic Programming

## Problem Description

Given two strings s and t, return the number of distinct subsequences of s which equals t.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits on a 32-bit signed integer.

## Examples

### Example 1:

Input: s = "rabbbit", t = "rabbit"

Output: 3

Explanation: As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from s.

`rabb`b`it`

`ra`b`bbit`

`rab`b`bit`

### Example 2:

Input: s = "babgbag", t = "bag"

Output: 5

Explanation: As shown below, there are 5 ways you can generate "bag" from s.

`ba`b`g`bag`

`ba`bgba`g`

`b`abgb`ag`

`ba`b`gb`ag`

`babg`bag`

## Constraints

• `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 1000`

• `s` and `t` consist of English letters.
