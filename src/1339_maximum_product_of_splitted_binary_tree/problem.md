# 1339. Maximum Product of Splitted Binary Tree

[LeetCode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-of-splitted-binary-tree/)

Given the root of a binary tree, split the binary tree into two subtrees by removing one edge such that the product of the sums of the subtrees is maximized.

Return the maximum product of the sums of the two subtrees. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

Note that you need to remove exactly one edge to split the tree.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: 110
Explanation: Remove the red edge and get 2 binary trees with sum 11 and 10. Their product is 110 (11*10)
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4,null,null,5,6]
Output: 90
```

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 5 * 10^4].
- 1 <= Node.val <= 10^4
