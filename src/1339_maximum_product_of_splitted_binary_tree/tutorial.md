# Tutorial: Maximum Product of Splitted Binary Tree (LeetCode 1339)

## Key Concepts
- Binary tree traversal (postorder)
- Subtree sum calculation
- Maximizing a product by splitting the tree at one edge
- Modulo arithmetic

## Approach Outline
- Compute the total sum of the tree using postorder traversal
- For each subtree, consider the product of its sum and the sum of the rest of the tree
- Track the maximum product found
- Return the result modulo 10^9 + 7
