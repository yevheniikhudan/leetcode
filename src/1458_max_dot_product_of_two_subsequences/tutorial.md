# Tutorial: Max Dot Product of Two Subsequences (LeetCode 1458)

## Key Concepts
- Dynamic Programming (DP)
- Subsequence selection
- Handling negative numbers and empty subsequences

## Approach Outline
- Use DP to track the maximum dot product for each prefix of nums1 and nums2
- At each step, decide to pair current elements, skip from nums1, or skip from nums2
- Ensure at least one pair is chosen (no empty subsequences)
- Handle negative results and edge cases
