# Tutorial: Binary Tree Postorder Traversal (LeetCode 145)

## Key Concepts
- Binary tree traversal
- Postorder: left, right, root
- Recursive and iterative approaches
- Stack usage for iterative traversal

## Approach Outline
- Recursive: Traverse left, then right, then process root
- Iterative: Use a stack to simulate recursion, track visited nodes
- Handle empty tree and single-node cases
