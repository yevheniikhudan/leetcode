# 152. Maximum Product Subarray

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Topics:** Array, Dynamic Programming

## Problem Description

Given an integer array `nums`, find a subarray that has the largest product, and return the product.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.

Note that the product of an array with a single element is the value of that element.

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:** nums = [2,3,-2,4]  
**Output:** 6  
**Explanation:** [2,3] has the largest product 6.

### Example 2:
**Input:** nums = [-2,0,-1]  
**Output:** 0  
**Explanation:** The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.

## Constraints
- `1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^4`
- `-10 <= nums[i] <= 10`
- The product of any subarray of `nums` is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
