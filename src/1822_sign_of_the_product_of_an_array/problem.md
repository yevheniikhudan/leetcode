# 1822. Sign of the Product of an Array

[LeetCode Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/sign-of-the-product-of-an-array/description/)

There is a function signFunc(x) that returns:
- 1 if x is positive.
- -1 if x is negative.
- 0 if x is equal to 0.

You are given an integer array nums. Let product be the product of all values in the array nums.

Return signFunc(product).

**Example:**
Input: nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,3,2,1]
Output: 1

**Constraints:**
- 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
- -100 <= nums[i] <= 100
