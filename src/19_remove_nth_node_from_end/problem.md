# 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List

**Difficulty:** Medium

## Problem Statement

Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:** head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2

**Output:** [1,2,3,5]

**Explanation:** The 2nd node from the end is node 4, so we remove it.

```
Before: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5
After:  1 → 2 → 3 → 5
```

### Example 2:

**Input:** head = [1], n = 1

**Output:** []

**Explanation:** After removing the only node, the list is empty.

### Example 3:

**Input:** head = [1,2], n = 1

**Output:** [1]

**Explanation:** Remove the last node (2).

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the list is `sz`.
- `1 <= sz <= 30`
- `0 <= Node.val <= 100`
- `1 <= n <= sz`

## Follow-up

Could you do this in one pass?

## Topics

- Linked List
- Two Pointers

## Hints

1. Maintain two pointers and update one with a delay of n steps.
2. Use a dummy head to handle edge cases more elegantly.
