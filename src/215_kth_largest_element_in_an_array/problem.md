**Difficulty:** Medium

## Topics

## Problem Description
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the `k`th largest element in the array.

Note that it is the `k`th largest element in the sorted order, not the `k`th distinct element.

Can you solve it without sorting?

### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [3,2,1,5,6,4], k = 2
Output: 5
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6], k = 4
Output: 4
```

## Constraints
- 1 <= k <= nums.length <= 10^5
- -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
