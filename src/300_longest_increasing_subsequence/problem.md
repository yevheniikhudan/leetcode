# 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Topics:** Array, Binary Search, Dynamic Programming

## Problem Description

Given an integer array `nums`, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:** nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]  
**Output:** 4  
**Explanation:** The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.

### Example 2:
**Input:** nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]  
**Output:** 4

### Example 3:
**Input:** nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]  
**Output:** 1

## Constraints
- `1 <= nums.length <= 2500`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`

## Follow Up
Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in `O(n log n)` time complexity?
