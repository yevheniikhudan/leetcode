## Problem Description

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the `k` most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2]
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,1,2,1,2,3,1,3,2], k = 2
Output: [1,2]
```

## Constraints
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
- `k` is in the range `[1, the number of unique elements in the array]`.
- It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.

## Follow-up
Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than `O(n log n)`, where n is the array's size.
