# 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

**Difficulty**: Medium

**Topics**: Hash Table, String, Sliding Window

## Problem Description

Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest substring** without duplicate characters.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

## Constraints

- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10⁴`
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
