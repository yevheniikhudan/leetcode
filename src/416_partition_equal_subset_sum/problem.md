# 416. Partition Equal Subset Sum

## Difficulty: Medium

## Topics: Array, Dynamic Programming

## Problem Description

Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if you can partition the array into two subsets such that the sum of the elements in both subsets is equal or `false` otherwise.

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:** nums = [1,5,11,5]  
**Output:** true  
**Explanation:** The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11].

### Example 2:
**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,5]  
**Output:** false  
**Explanation:** The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum subsets.

## Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 200`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`
