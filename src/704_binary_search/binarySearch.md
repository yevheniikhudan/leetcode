# 704. Binary Search

## Problem Description

Given an array of integers `nums` which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer `target`, write a function to search `target` in `nums`. If `target` exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return `-1`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `-10^4 < nums[i], target < 10^4`
- All the integers in `nums` are **unique**
- `nums` is sorted in ascending order
