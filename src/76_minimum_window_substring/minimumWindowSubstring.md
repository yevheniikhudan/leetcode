# 76. Minimum Window Substring

**Difficulty**: Hard

**Topics**: Hash Table, String, Sliding Window

## Problem Description

Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return *the **minimum window substring** of* `s` *such that every character in* `t` *(including duplicates) is included in the window*. If there is no such substring, return the empty string `""`.

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is **unique**.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: ""
Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.
```

## Constraints

- `m == s.length`
- `n == t.length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 10⁵`
- `s` and `t` consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

## Follow-up

Could you find an algorithm that runs in `O(m + n)` time?

## Hints

1. Use two pointers to create a window of letters in s, which would have all the characters from t.
2. Expand the right pointer until all the characters of t are covered.
3. Once all the characters are covered, move the left pointer and ensure that all the characters are still covered to minimize the subarray size.
4. Continue expanding the right and left pointers until you reach the end of s.
