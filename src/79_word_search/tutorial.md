# Tutorial: Word Search (LeetCode 79)

## Key Concepts
- Backtracking (DFS)
- Grid traversal
- Marking visited cells
- Pruning invalid paths

## Approach Outline
- For each cell, start a DFS if it matches the first character of the word
- At each step, mark the cell as visited and explore neighbors
- Unmark the cell after exploring (backtrack)
- Return true if the word is found, false otherwise
