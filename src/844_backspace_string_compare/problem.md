# 844. Backspace String Compare

[LeetCode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/backspace-string-compare/)

Given two strings s and t, return true if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. '#' means a backspace character.

Note that after backspacing an empty text, the text will continue empty.

Example:

```
Input: s = "ab#c", t = "ad#c"
Output: true

Input: s = "ab##", t = "c#d#"
Output: true

Input: s = "a#c", t = "b"
Output: false
```
