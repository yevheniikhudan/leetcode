# 846. Hand of Straights

## Difficulty: Medium

## Topics: Array, Hash Table, Greedy, Sorting

## Problem Description

Alice has some number of cards and she wants to rearrange the cards into groups so that each group is of size `groupSize`, and consists of `groupSize` consecutive cards.

Given an integer array `hand` where `hand[i]` is the value written on the `i`th card and an integer `groupSize`, return `true` if she can rearrange the cards, or `false` otherwise.

## Examples

### Example 1:

Input: hand = [1,2,3,6,2,3,4,7,8], groupSize = 3

Output: true

Explanation: Alice's hand can be rearranged as [1,2,3],[2,3,4],[6,7,8]

### Example 2:

Input: hand = [1,2,3,4,5], groupSize = 4

Output: false

## Constraints

• `1 <= hand.length <= 10^4`
• `0 <= hand[i] <= 10^9`
• `1 <= groupSize <= hand.length`
