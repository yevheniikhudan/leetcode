# Tutorial: Subsets II (LeetCode 90)

## Key Concepts
- Backtracking for generating all subsets
- Handling duplicates in input
- Sorting to group duplicates
- Skipping duplicate branches during recursion

## Approach Outline
- Sort the input array to bring duplicates together
- Use backtracking to explore all subset possibilities
- At each recursion level, skip elements that are the same as the previous one (if not at the start of the loop)
- Collect all unique subsets in the result list
