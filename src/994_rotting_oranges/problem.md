# 994. Rotting Oranges

[LeetCode Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/)

You are given an m x n grid where each cell can have one of three values:
- 0 representing an empty cell,
- 1 representing a fresh orange,
- 2 representing a rotten orange.

Every minute, any fresh orange that is 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten orange becomes rotten.

Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange. If this is impossible, return -1.

**Example:**

Input:
```
grid = [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
```
Output: 4

**Constraints:**
- m == grid.length
- n == grid[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 10
- grid[i][j] is 0, 1, or 2.
